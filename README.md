## Hi there 👋

With SierraVault, your documents are finally secured. This is not just another application to store files — it is a national solution to a national problem that has affected Sierra Leone for decades. Lost documents, burnt files, damaged certificates, missing records… those days are over.

SierraVault is the most secure and dependable digital vault built on a highly protected blockchain system, designed to store your most important documents for your eyes and your access only.

What truly makes SierraVault stand out from every other platform is our enhanced login system. We introduced an optional NIN-based access feature, allowing users to connect their National Identification Number and verify their identity. This unlocks the ability to receive official government documents directly inside SierraVault, giving citizens a safer, faster, and more trustworthy way to access national services.

And we didn’t only build for the digitally educated — we built for everyone. That is why we integrated an AI Krio text-to-speech assistant. With just a tap, the AI reads out every page in clear Krio or English, making navigation simple, inclusive, and accessible to every Sierra Leonean, no matter their literacy level.

SierraVault isn’t just an app.
It is digital empowerment.
It is data security.
It is national progress.

SierraVault is how Sierra Leone secures its future — one document at a time.
